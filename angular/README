 ## Development Environment

 We use [Docker Compose] to setup a development environment. Here's a typical Angular configuration:

 `docker-compose.yml`: services we use and link with the app
 `Dockerfile.local`: a file to define local environment for our app


 Run sh in container:

 ```sh
 docker-compose run web /bin/sh
 ```

 Boot the stack with:

 ```sh
 docker-compose up
 ```

 Whenever you make changes to `Dockerfile.local` you'll have rebuild using:

 ```sh
 docker-compose build
 ```
